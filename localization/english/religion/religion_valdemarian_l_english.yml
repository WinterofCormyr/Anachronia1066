 doctrine_valdemarian_polygamy_name:0 "Valdemarian Polygamous"
 doctrine_valdemarian_polygamy_desc:0 "The teachings of the Gods say that marriage is sacred, but ultimately a matter of the secular world. Common practice indicates that up to eight spouses may be taken by a person, of any gender as befitting of their orientation, but this is not required, and taking nine or more spouses is highly taboo. Likewise, love of any form can be found even beyond marriage, as long as all agree upon it, and as long as the marriages themselves are held to their rightful paramount position."

 tenet_scholarship_of_scripture_desc:1 "The ancient myths and texts hold deep meaning, and not all is as it seems at first glance. By studying them, meditating on their words, and practicing the ways of the prophets before us, we can realize deeper spiritual perfection, and work for a world that is more connected to that divinity and sacred essence-force."

 tenet_pseudognostic_name:0 "Pseudognostic"
 tenet_pseudognostic_desc:1 "While we differ from our gnostic brethren in asserting that there is not a demiurge, if there even is a creator, we find them wise in many other manners. It is the duty, perhaps even the obligation, of all true believers to work towards enlightment and union with the Monad, and those granted special gifts along this path are incredibly holy indeed. We must remember that the pleasures of the flesh are temporary, and the joy of spiritual perfection is eternal - once it has been achieved."
