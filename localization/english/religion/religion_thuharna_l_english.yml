 thuhar_na_religion_desc:0 "The Thuhar'na are a pantheon orifinally revealed to the first empress of Siberia, Tammy Gyichangmol, where they served as the 'evil' pantheon, to contrast the Aniar'na. They are not *evil* per se, but morally grey, often operating under an alien morality system, and their faiths have been practiced - often in secret - since the death of Empress Tammy herself. They are incredibly diverse, often very compartmentalized, as the Thuhar'na do *not* generally get along with each other, though there are exceptions."

 cult_of_azeroth_desc:0 "The Cult of Azeroth is a Thuhar'na faith centering around the goddess Azeroth, the Dusklight (also called the Sparkling Twilight, the Lady of the Crimson Gate, the Mother Soul, Moonshadow, the Mother of the Rose, the Queen of the Night's Sky, or the Cosmic Severer, who is known as Azurah to the Tavar're), goddess of dusk and dawn. The religion believes that Azeroth is the goddess of ego and ambition, in addition to her more obvious sphere. She is nevertheless 'altruistic' by some definition, and is considered one of the 'good Thuhar'na' by both the Night Buryat Clan (along with Mafhella and Besra, whose domains are the liminality between sex and death, and intrigue, respectively) and many of the otherwise intolerant of Thuhar'na worship Aniar'na followers and traditions. She promises a good afterlife for her believers, salvation from both the bad afterlives of other Thuhar'na and from the eternal reincarnation of the dreamsleeve. She also encourages her followers to pursue their dreams, whatever they are to an extent."
